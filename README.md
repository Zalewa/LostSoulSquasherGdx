# LostSoulSquasherGdx

Java/libGDX version of Lost Soul Squasher

# More info

This is a port of .NET/XNA version that is available here:
https://github.com/Zalewa/LostSoulSquasher

Most of the README.md from this other project also applies here.
There are no major functionality changes besides support for Android.
Code, in contrast, is structured in Java packages, where .NET code
is dumped into a single directory.
